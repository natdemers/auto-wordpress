1.) From your own local machine, create an ansible image for docker
    docker build -t ansible .

2.) Set your AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Key as environmental variables with the commands:
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='your_access_key_id'
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='your_secret_access_key'

3.) To run within the bash shell, source the following executable. This bash script
    assumes the AWS Keys are stored as environmental variables.
    . run

4.) Provision an EC2 Instance using:
    ansible-playbook -i hosts launch_ec2.yml

5.) Install and run Wordpress using the following command. Note the ec2.py inventory file.
    To specify a custom domain name, use -e "wp_home_site=some_site.com" within the command.
    ansible-playbook -i ec2.py site.yml

6.) To see the Wordpress blog, type in your web browser the public IP of the EC2 instance, 
    or the custom URL passed in. 

7.) Once finished, tear down the instance and remove the key pair using the command:
    ansible-playbook -i hosts terminate_ec2.yml

8.) Exit out of the bash shell by invoking:
    exit
